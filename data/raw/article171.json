    "text": "VICTORIA, British Columbia -- A Canadian woman's idea to make a lawn ornament out of a picture of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been trending on social media.\nThe Washington Post reported on May 10 that Spicer had been among the bushes with his staff late the night before as reporters waited to question him about President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.\nThe Post's Jenna Johnson said in a video that Spicer did an interview with Fox Business then, \"As soon as it was done, instead of coming toward the reporters who were waiting for him, he went the back way. It was very dark, and he was back in this kind of bushy area with all of these leafy bushes and trees and was huddling with his staff back there, and we were waiting for him. We knew he had to come by us to get back into the White House. And so we waited him out.\"\nShe continued, in a story on the same page, \"After Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the darkness and among the bushes … Janet Montesi, an executive assistant in the press office, emerged and told reporters that Spicer would answer some questions, as long as he was not filmed doing so. Spicer then emerged … and was soon standing in near darkness between two tall hedges, with more than a dozen reporters closely gathered around him.\"\nThat sent university professor Lisa Kadonaga looking for a headshot of Spicer. She had it blown up and printed, then put it in some shrubbery at a local bank in Victoria, British Columbia. She photographed it and shared the picture with her Facebook friends.\nKadonaga says she figured a few people might get a laugh out of it and was \"shocked\" to soon find her Spicer in the bush cutout trending on Twitter.",
