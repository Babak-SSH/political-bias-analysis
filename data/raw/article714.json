It was part of the San Bernardino shooting, a part of the Boston bombing. But you said you don’t know how to stop that. If that’s the biggest threat and you don’t know how to stop it, that seems like a big problem.\nKELLY: It is a big problem. It is ― you know, depending on where you sit is where you stand on this, it is a big threat. Is it the number one threat? I think it’s the most common threat. ...\nI think the appeal I would make on the homegrown threat is if you see something, say something. Whether you’re a parent, a sibling, an imam. And this extends frankly, John, to white supremacists and that kind of terrorism as well. If you see a young man or a young woman going down that path where they’re always on these kind of websites or saying things at church or in a mosque that are clearly disturbing, then tell someone about it so that we can help that kid, young man or woman, before they break the law.",
