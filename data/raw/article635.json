The law requires that the investigation be concluded within 270 days, but Ross said the timeline will be expedited.\nU.S. prominence in the steel industry has been slipping for decades.\nAccording to the Belgium-based World Steel Association, American-made steel once accounted for roughly 20 percent of global production, but had slipped to less than 5 percent by 2015.\nChina made up less than 3 percent of U.S. steel imports.\nFox News’ Lesa Jansen and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
