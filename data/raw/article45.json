    "text": "— -- The Senate has passed a $1 trillion omnibus spending bill that would keep the government running until September, with a vote of 79-18.\nThe House passed the bill Wednesday in a 309-118 vote, with four members abstaining.\nThe spending bill will now head to President Trump’s desk.\nLast Friday, Congress passed a short-term measure funding the government for one more week, giving lawmakers additional time to tie up loose ends.\nThe resulting deal, reached late Sunday night, includes a $15 billion boost in funding for the military. The spending bill also contains $1.5 billion for border security. However, it leaves out funding for the wall that Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border but includes funds for Planned Parenthood and so-called sanctuary cities.\n“After years of partisan bickering and gridlock, this bill is a clear win for the American people,” Trump said Tuesday from the Oval Office. “It’s been a very hotly contested budget because, as you know, we have to go through a long and rigorous process.”\n“I think that Democrats cleaned our clock,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN in an interview on Tuesday. “This was not winning from the Republican point of view.”\nIf Trump signs the bill, Congress will avoid a government shutdown until at least September, when funding would next run out.\nABC News’ Ali Rogin and Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",
