W. Bush) and Mexico (George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan) first.\nThe official explained: “the reason why we chose the Saudis first is because they are the custodians of the two Holy Mosques.”\nAsked for elaboration, the official added, \"We thought that was very important because obviously people have tried to portray the president in a certain way, but I think that what he wants to do is solve the same problem that a lot of the leaders in the Islamic world want to do.\"\nSaudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and the location of two of the religion's holiest sites.\nThe official explained that the administration expects Saudi Arabia to bring together a number of leaders from majority-Muslim countries in order to discuss common interests as a group.\n\"We thought that that was a good place to start and look one of the biggest problems that we face in the world today is radical extremism and we have to combat,\" said the official.\nAccording to the official, the transition team started working with the Saudis on the visit shortly after the election.",
