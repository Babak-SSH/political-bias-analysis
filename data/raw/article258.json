What this President wants to be remembered for is not the name that is put on it, but the person that got rid of Obamacare and put a system in place that actually works for the American people,\" she said. \"That is the type of legacy he would like to be focused on.\"\nShe added: \"Call it what you want, but we are calling it reform and a system that works.\"",
