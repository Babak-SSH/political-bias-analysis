Email sent yesterday to CBER, the biologics section at #FDA pic.twitter.com/9H9BtRGtKV â€” Paul Thacker (@thackerpd) May 5, 2017\n\"The reason for the change is that a decision from the current administration administrative officials has requested that all monitors, under our control, on the White Oak Campus, display FOX news,\" the email reads. \"Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am unable to change any of the monitors to any other news source at this time.\"\nThe email was sent by a customer service representative from the agency's facilities office, according to FDA.\nHowever, an FDA spokeswoman denied that the administration had made such a request, insisting that a variety of news stations play on its TVs, including CNN, MSNBC and Fox News.\n\"There was no directive or memorandum from the administration that went out to employees about broadcast news channels displaying on monitors in common areas throughout the FDA's White Oak campus,\" she said in an email.\nFDA's White Oak campus, which serves as the agency's headquarters, is located in Silver Spring, Md.",
