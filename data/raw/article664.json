The body then swiftly took another, 55-45 vote to end debate and tee up a final confirmation vote expected at 11:30 a.m. ET Friday.\nThis was after Democrats initially blocked Gorsuch in a filibuster earlier in the day. Four Democrats broke ranks -- Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.; and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. – but Republicans still fell short of the 60 votes needed to proceed, prompting McConnell to overhaul the way the Senate works.\nHe said he did so “for the sake of our country.”\nBennet later opposed Gorsuch on the do-over vote.\nWhile congressional Republicans and President Trump are now virtually guaranteed to get Gorsuch on the high court, the impact of the events that played out Thursday could be felt for years, if not decades, to come. Each party blamed the other for the escalation and the breakdown in the Senate’s parliamentary decorum.\nIndeed, McConnell’s predecessor as Senate majority leader Harry Reid, now retired, took the first step down the “nuclear” road by lowering the threshold for other nominees in 2013 – a controversial move Republicans frequently brought up on the road to Thursday’s proceedings.\nBut lowering the threshold for a Supreme Court pick is a more significant step. It means for the foreseeable future, the minority party will have significantly less leverage to oppose any nominee to the highest court in the land, no matter who is president.\nSchumer said there will be “less faith in the Supreme Court” going forward.\nMcConnell, kicking off Thursday’s session, blasted Democrats for the filibuster attempt and accused them of driving the upper chamber to this point. He said their opposition to Gorsuch isn’t about the nominee but “the man who nominated him” – and part of an “extreme escalation in the left’s never-ending drive to politicize the courts and the confirmation process.”\nRepublicans say Democrats have been unfair to an otherwise eminently qualified nominee and have wrongly cast him as an ideologue.\nHowever, despite exhaustive confirmation hearings where Gorsuch, like many nominees before him, declined to take clear stances on hot-button issues, Democrats largely are convinced he would be a staunch conservative in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia, whose seat he would fill on the nine-member court. They pointed to past rulings on cases where he sided with businesses against workers, though his allies maintain he was merely applying the law as written. Democrats also are still furious over Republicans’ refusal to consider former President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, howled over the GOP majority’s move to deploy the “nuclear option” to get Gorsuch approved in the end. They warn it will drastically change the way the Senate operates for the worse.\n“It doesn’t have to be this way,” Schumer said. “The answer is not to change the rules, it’s to change the nominee.”\nHe also said Gorsuch “may very well turn out to be one of the most conservative justices on the bench.”\nThe actual deployment of the nuclear option was cloaked in obscure parliamentary-speak.\nMcConnell, after the initial Democratic filibuster, asked for a simple majority vote “on all nominations.”\nThe presiding officer said the point of order was not sustained. McConnell, with seven fateful words, said: “I appeal the ruling of the chair.”\nHis party backed him, eliminating the 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court nominees.\nFox News’ Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",
