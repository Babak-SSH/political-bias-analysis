CBS News\nPelley asked Morell if he felt better that, according to National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster, no methods or sources were compromised.\n\"Not a lot better… but not sharing that source or method does not make any better the problems I outlined earlier,\" he said.\nMORE: \"At no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed,\" H.R. McMaster says, denying report: https://t.co/6XEQ0A2tDF pic.twitter.com/HzSkSm7Rkb — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 15, 2017\nFor more on this, watch the video in the player above.\nMeanwhile, a senior White House official, who was in the room with Mr. Trump and the Russian officials, repeated what others have said today that The Washington Post story isn't true.
