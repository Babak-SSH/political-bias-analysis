It was meant to send a message to the Assad regime not to use chemical weapons.\nAfter the chemical weapons attack in Syria’s Idlib Province, a Russian drone was seen flying over a hospital where victims of the chemical weapons attack were taken. Five hours later, the hospital was bombed.\nU.S. officials have yet to determine whether a Syrian or Russian jet bombed the hospital because the Syrian Air Force fly Russian-made jets.\nFox News' Yonat Friling contributed to this report.",
