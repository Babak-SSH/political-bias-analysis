    "text": "Sean Spicer compares the 2016 election to the Super Bowl\nTrump spokesman Sean Spicer does what many people do when trying to explain how things work: he talks about sports.\nAt Wednesday's press briefing, Spicer was asked to comment on Hillary Clinton's statements that she would have won the election had FBI Director James Comey not publicly revealed that he was reopening the probe into her use of a private email server.\nSpicer's response: \"Well, look, I'm a Patriots fan, and if games ended in third quarter, it would have been a different team here last week.* But you play a game four quarters. You play an election until Election Day. With all due respect to her, you don't get to pick the day the election is on.\"\nHe added, \"It's somewhat sad that we're still debating why the president won in the fashion that he did.\"\n*For the non-sports fans among us, in the last Super Bowl, the New England Patriots were trailing the Atlanta Falcons at the end of the third quarter before making a comeback and winning the championship.",
