Counsel,\" he wrote, originally misspelling \"counsel\" and later correcting it.\nAt today’s White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer refused to elaborate on the president’s tweet.\n\"I think the tweet speaks for itself. Sometimes you don't have to read too much into it,\" Spicer said.\nTrump posted another tweet on the topic — but not about Yates directly — nearly 20 minutes earlier. In that tweet, he pointed the finger at the Obama administration for giving Flynn \"the highest security clearance.\"\nYates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper are scheduled to appear in front of the committee today.",
