    "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump may be a new face on the international stage, but visiting foreign leaders from around the globe have quickly embraced a strategy for currying favor: flattery.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May cribbed some of Trump's own talking points about himself, lauding his 2016 election win as \"stunning\" during her visit in January and saying Trump, like her, was a president for the \"ordinary working people.\"\nAnd Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu name-checked Trump's seminal book -- \"The Art of the Deal\" -- while casting him as a stronger leader than his predecessor: \"Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership, I'm confident it will get even stronger.\"\nMost recently, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told Trump Wednesday that his \"great negotiating ability\" will make peace with Israel more likely.\n\"I believe that we are capable, under your leadership and your courageous stewardship and your wisdom, as well your great negotiating ability,\" Abbas said through a translator. \"I believe with the grace of God, and with all of your effort, we believe that we can be partners, true partners to you, to bring about a historic peace treaty.\"\nJUST WATCHED Abbas: With Trump's wisdom, peace is possible Replay More Videos ...

This President's style is one to develop a personal bond with individuals.\"\nTrump has not hidden his ego throughout his decades-long business career. His name is his brand and it's plastered on buildings around the world. His campaign regulatory filing valued it at $3.32 billion. Trump has also fashioned himself a dealmaker of historic proportions since his earliest days on the New York real estate scene, someone who knows when to push the person across the table because he understands people.\nHe has even mentioned his history as a dealmaker to seemingly explain why flattery could work well on him.\nTrump called the comments a \"great honor.\"\n\"I know people, because deals are people. If Putin respects me, and if Putin wants to call me brilliant, and other things that he said which were, frankly, very nice, I'll accept that,\" Trump said. \"And I'll accept that on behalf of our country, because if we get along well with Russia, that's a positive thing.\"\nJUST WATCHED Netanyahu, Trump to rekindle US-Israel bond Replay More Videos ...

More recently, reporters, like The Irish Times' Simon Carswell, have written about how positive articles about Trump or his properties have been received warmly.\n\"Thanks to you and the wonderful Simon Carswell for the great story on Trump International Golf Links, Ireland. It will be great,\" Trump tweeted in 2014.\n@IrishTimes Thanks to you and the wonderful Simon Carswell for the great story on Trump International Golf Links, Ireland. It will be great â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2014\nThose tendencies have followed Trump to the White House.\n\"Strong hands,\" Trump said in the Oval Office about Japan's Abe, mimicking a golf swing in the process.\nAbe, visibly taken aback by the comment, responded with a laugh.",
