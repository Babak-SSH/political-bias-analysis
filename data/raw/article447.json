    "text": "President Trump deletes tweet about meeting with Palestinian leader Abbas\nPresident Trump on Thursday deleted a tweet about his meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, despite the tweet simply reiterating what he said publicly.\n\"An honor to host President Mahmoud Abbas at the WH today. Hopefully something terrific will come out of it between the Palestinians and Israel,\" Trump said in the tweet, written on the day he welcomed the leader of the Palestinian Authority.\nDuring remarks on Wednesday, Trump said he was pleased to welcome Abbas to the White House and pledged to bring a lasting peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis.\nThe deletion of the tweet, noted by ProPublica's Politwoops, came about 13 hours after the president posted it on Wednesday. It isn't clear why the president deleted the tweet.\nIt's at least the 12th tweet the president has deleted since he took office, per Politwoops and USA TODAY analysis. Some of the deletions have been to correct misspellings or remove words, while others have been to add more context.\nThe president's deletion of tweets has raised the question of whether doing so violates the Presidential Records Act, which mandates the preservation of all presidential records. The National Archives has advised the administration to \"capture and preserve all tweets that the President postsâ€¦ including those that are subsequently deleted,\" according to Gizmodo.",
