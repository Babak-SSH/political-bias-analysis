Alongside countless one-line zingers mocking Trump‚Äôs eldest son, some users took to Photoshop, placing Jr. and his ‚Äúfake news‚Äù garb within actual historical events, such as the moon landing and George Washington crossing the Delaware.\nAdvertisement\nThen there were the scores of tweets sending very different messages.\nI'm going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the #MSM. In the meantime I'll model it for themüòÇ. #yourewelcome pic.twitter.com/Hnn3Z5Pspm ‚Äî Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) April 15, 2017\nAdvertisement\n@DonaldJTrumpJr North Korea's threatening nuclear war, 43 million Americans live in poverty, and your dad's under FBI investigation.
