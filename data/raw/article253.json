On the campaign trail, candidate Trump promised to \"cancel\" the accord. It's the world's first comprehensive climate agreement -- adopted by nearly 200 nations.\nTodd Stern, former US special envoy for climate change under President Barack Obama, also says it could affect the United States' ability to seek international cooperation on a whole host of other issues, not just climate matters.\n\"It's a kind of 'To hell with you' with respect to an issue that countries have been enormously concerned about,\" Stern told CNN's \"The Lead\" with Jake Tapper on Friday. \"You will see US credibility and leverage in the international community absolutely reduced, because this is an issue that people care about, and that they know they can't solve without US engagement.\"\nAlso under consideration by the Trump administration: whether to remain in the agreement, and simply reduce the United States' commitment to reduce its carbon emissions 26%-28% from 2005 levels by 2025.
