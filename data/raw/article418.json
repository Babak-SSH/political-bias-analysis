Roe won't let health care vote keep him from getting to the church on time\nShow Caption Hide Caption White House: Health care vote chances 'greater' White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined to say when a vote on an Obamacare replacement might happen, but he said the chances of a vote are, 'greater and greater every day.' (May 3) AP\nThe possibility of a Thursday vote to repeal and replace Obamacare has Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., nervous due to a pre-existing condition: He's engaged to be married on Saturday.\nRoe, liked many lawmakers, expected to leave the capital on Thursday for a week-long recess, but his plans are now up in the air amid plans for a vote on health care Thursday.\nIf the vote is on Thursday as planned — or even if it gets bumped back to Friday — Roe vows to be there. But, he told CNN, the chance of a Saturday vote has the self-described \"unlucky\" Roe feeling \"anxious.\"\n\"I could see this trainwreck happening two weeks ago,\" he told CNN. \"That's why I don't buy lottery tickets. I never bought one because I'm so unlucky.\"\n\"If the vote's on Friday, I'll vote on Friday and I'll drive home or get home some way,\" Roe said. \"I'll figure out how to get to Tennessee.\"\nRoe is staying positive.\n\"There's not going to be a Saturday vote,\" Roe told CNN. \"I'm going to my wedding Saturday.\"",
