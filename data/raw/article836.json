    "text": "Top Trump Administration counterterrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka abruptly left a panel on fake news at Georgetown University on Monday after he was questioned about his work at Breitbart and links to a far right Hungarian group with Nazi ties, three people who were there told NBC News.\nDuring a roughly six-minute statement, which NBC News obtained a recording of, Gorka described allegations that he belongs to the group Vitezi Rend as a \"propaganda campaign\" and said that protesters quietly holding signs during the event were \"victims of fake news.\"\nSebastian Gorka poses with his wife at an inaugural ball wearing a medal from the Hungarian Order of Heroes, Vitezi Rend.

One student, Roey Hadar, raised a column that Gorka wrote when he was an editor at Breitbart — which Hadar called a “yellow journalism rag\" — that described the New York Times and the Washington Post as “shills” for “the Jihadis.”\nHadar asked if such \"anti-Muslim rhetoric\" legitimized groups like ISIS.\n\"Could you quote for me exactly what I said,\" Gorka replied.\nHadar pressed for an answer, to which Gorka responded: \"No. If you’re going to sling accusations against me, a word-for-word verbatim quote because you are lying or misinformed.\"\nStudents moved on to several more questions. Meshnick asked if the administration created fake news by accusing Susan Rice of committing a crime (\"He said: ‘You don’t know anything — I’m not going to answer your questions,'\" Meshnick recalled).\nAnother student asked if Gorka would disavow Vitezi Rend. A university researcher who attended the panel, Mobashra Tazamal, told NBC News that he didn’t, and during his statement, Gorka said the organization had a single purpose: battling communism.\nAfter five questions, Tazmal said, Gorka stood up and said the rest of the panel should have a chance to speak.\nThen he left.\n“We’re wondering how a bunch of 20-year-olds with signs and facts scared away the president’s counterterrorism advisor,” Meshnick said. “Why was that so intimidating to him?”\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
