    "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\nThree Democrats broke ranks Friday to support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court.\nThey are: Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.\nAll are moderate Democrats facing challenging reelection bids next year in red states.\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who voted to cut off debate Thursday and had co-introduced Gorsuch -- also from Colorado -- at his confirmation hearing, voted against Gorsuch in the end.\nAll Republicans present voted for Gorsuch. The final tally was 54-45.\nWhile most Democrats adamantly opposed President Trump’s nominee, he advanced to a final vote after Republicans overcame a Democratic filibuster by changing Senate precedent – and allowing the nomination to advance with just a simple majority of senators.\nGorsuch is expected to be sworn in Monday.",
