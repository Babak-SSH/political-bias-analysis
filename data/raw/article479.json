It will also be Patterson's first collaboration with a president.\n\"Working with President Clinton has been the highlight of my career, and having access to his first-hand experience has uniquely informed the writing of this novel,\" Patterson said in a statement. \"I'm a storyteller, and President Clinton's insight has allowed us to tell a really interesting one.
