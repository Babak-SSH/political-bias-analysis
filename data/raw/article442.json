He then points backward to the smashed vehicle, adding, \"And we'll make sure this never happens in Virginia.\"\nAnd for anyone who's curious, Perriello's campaign said they found the scrap ambulance in the Washington, D.C., metro area and shot it in one take.\nPerriello — a one-term congressman who lost in 2010, became president of the Center for American Progress and served in the Obama administration as a diplomat — is running against Ralph Northam, the state's lieutenant governor, to be the Democratic nominee in the Virginia gubernatorial race. The primary is in June.\nWatch the ad here:",
