Big league.”\nAs a sign of his support, Trump let his hair blow in the wind as he made his outdoor remarks.\n“Just to show you, by the way, how much I love our police, I said, `Oh, I’m going to need a hat because it’s so windy today,’” the 45h president told the crowd as he held up a white hat with the number 45 on the side and USA on the front. “When I got out here, I said, `There’s no way I’m going to put on this hat.’ So we’ll leave off the hat.”\nTrump tossed the hat to Micah Glasser, the six-year-old son of a fallen Phoenix officer.\nWhile Glasser got the hat, Twitter got to comment on Trump’s hair.\nPres. Trump is having a really bad hair day today in more ways than one. Why not bald with dignity? pic.twitter.com/wge6gEu9EW — Rafal Hill (@rafalhill) May 15, 2017",
