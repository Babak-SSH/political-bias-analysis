The new law still has to pass the US Senate.\n\"Well Mr President, you're right, in Australia and every other major country on Earth they guarantee health care to all people. They don't throw 24 million people off health insurance. So maybe when we get to the Senate we should start off with looking at the Australian health care system,\" Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\nAustralia has a universal health care system, known as Medicare, which gives citizens free access to doctors and public hospitals paid for by the government.",
