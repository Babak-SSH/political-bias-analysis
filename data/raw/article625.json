A police official briefing reporters said the investigation is in “preliminary stages” but there appears to be “no nexus to terrorism.”\n“This incident appears to be criminal in nature,” the official said, adding that the standoff started as a “traffic stop.”\nSources said the incident began when police saw the car driving erratically on Independence Avenue. After they tried to stop the vehicle, the driver did a U-turn near the Library of Congress and started driving the wrong way against traffic.\nCapitol Police then raised the barriers at the bottom of Capitol Hill to “trap” the vehicle inside the perimeter near the Botanic Garden and the Rayburn House Office Building.\nLAWMAKER sends video to me of shooting incident near Capitol.

The suspect was not hit. Further, police said no individuals were injured during the arrest.\nIt is unclear if the suspect had a weapon.\nThe chase occurred during the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, the height of Washington’s tourist season.\nThe incident near the Capitol comes on the heels of multiple recent cases of people jumping the fence at the White House.\nOn Sunday, a 38-year-old woman who had tried to jump a White House security fence last week, scaled a fence near the Treasury Building. Secret Service agents arrested her around 2:15 a.m.\nEarlier this month, a suspect named Jonathan Tuan Tran allegedly scaled two fences and a security gate to get on the White House grounds before he was arrested. Also this month, another man was arrested after jumping over a bike rack in an attempt to surmount the fence, and still another suspect was arrested for allegedly making a false bomb threat at a Secret Service checkpoint.\nFox News’ Chad Pergram contributed to this report.",
