And I think the line may have been blurred a little bit.\n\"He wanted to make it very clear, but at the same express confidence in the team that’s here and the talent that he has assembled,\" Spicer added.\nSpicer also addressed his now-infamous remark Tuesday that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons against his own people, a statement for which he later apologized.\nSPICER APOLOGIZES FOR HITLER COMMENTS\n\"It was just unfortunate that my mistake helped create a distraction from the great work that [Trump's] doing for this country and frankly throughout the world,\" Spicer said. \"My job is to help do what I can to advance this thing, not get in the way of it. Unfortunately, yesterday I did just that.\"\nSpicer said he had spoken to Trump about his comment, but did not specify what the president had told him.",
