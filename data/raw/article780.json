Molly Riley - Pool/Getty Images\nWASHINGTON ― The U.S. State Department has officially promoted President Donald Trump’s personal real estate.\nThe department’s ShareAmerica website posted an article on April 4 celebrating Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate with glitzy photos and flowery descriptions of the “ornate Jazz Age house,” which was “designed with Old-World Spanish, Venetian and Portuguese influences.” The piece was featured the next day on the websites and social media accounts of various American embassies abroad, all of which went largely overlooked until Monday, when the posts sparked a furor online.\nAdvertisement\nNorm Eisen, chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, lambasted the State Department on Twitter, arguing that it was illegal for the government to essentially advertise the president’s personal property.\nviolations of 5 CFR 2635.702 have gone viral thruout our embassies. trump gutting foreign aid to convert embassies 2 trump promo outlets! https://t.co/pgY0UjpJY0 — Norm Eisen (@NormEisen) April 24, 2017\nThe State Department did not respond to phone calls or emails seeking comment.\nSen.

The government returned Mar-a-Lago to the Post Foundation in 1981 because it was just too expensive to keep up.
