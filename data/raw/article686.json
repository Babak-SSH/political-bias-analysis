Kevin Brady, R-Texas, in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers.\nHouse Dems have been defeated three times this year in a battle over Trump’s tax returns.\nTrump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns is a break with presidential tradition. He has said he would be happy to release them after the completion of an IRS audit.\nSen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., told reporters Wednesday that 2020 presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns, including Trump if he runs for re-election.\n“I think that prospectively what I'll do is, any candidate running in 2020 needs to release their tax returns,” Graham told reporters, according to Politico.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
