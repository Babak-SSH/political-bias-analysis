I am grateful for your support and encouraging words; they mean a great deal. Together, we can empower more women to stand up for their beliefs.\"\nAlong with the photo of the first lady's letter, Anderson tweeted, \"Dear Melania, Thank you for your sweet note. It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace.\"\nA spokeswoman for the first lady also told CNN, \"She does not wear fur.\"\nWhen Anderson sent the coat in February, she included a note which read, \"Amid all the mania at the inauguration, you looked stunning in an outfit by Ralph Lauren—one of many fur-free designers. I am so happy that you chose not to wear fur! As first lady, you will help set style trends, and by remaining compassionate with your choices, you will warm the hearts of many.\"",
