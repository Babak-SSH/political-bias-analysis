Hide Caption 37 of 37\nTrump's visits to the Vatican, Israel and Saudi Arabia were first reported by Politico\nOther senior administration officials told CNN this is part of the strategy to reach out across religions and countries to combat extremism -- both to fight ISIS and to further isolate Iran. He will visit Jerusalem, Israel, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, according to a senior administration official.\nThere is also a clear interest among top aides in the White House to counter the view Trump has cultivated abroad.\n\"Saudi Arabia is going to convene a lot of the leaders from the Muslim world, and you will see that there is a lot of objectives they share with America,\" one senior administration official said.\nTrump ran on a ban of Muslims entering the United States, proposing the in a December 2015 announcement a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" until American officials could get a handle on terror. While his campaign slowly backed away from that pledge, one of Trump's first actions in the White House was to push a travel ban for seven - and eventually six - Muslim majority countries.\nThe trip is meant to show that Trump's \"America First\" motto is \"fully compatible with American leadership in the world,\" another official said.\nTrump's election has provided the United States with opportunities to \"re-engage the world,\" the officials said, given Trump's perceived unpredictability and that he is \"not dogmatic to one school of thought, (rather) open-minded, flexible and opportunistic.\"\nThe senior administration officials said it's a time when the Trump administration can pursue policies that \"strengthen our hand and weaken our enemies.\"\n\"Certain things will be formalized and announced in the time leading up to the visit,\" one senior administration official said.\nA second senior administration official said that a recent visit to Saudi Arabia revealed an open-mindedness to stepping up and leading in a way the official had not seen in the country since right after 9/11.\n\"Saudi Arabia realizes the challenges it has; and there is a similar feeling throughout the region,\" the official said.\nPart of the problem, the officials said, stems from the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, which they view as providing a path to a nuclear weapon for the country, as well as Iran's continued funding of terrorism throughout the region.\nThe officials add the administration has been working hard to produce a \"meaningful set of deliverables\" to be announced around the trip.\nTrump's first foreign trip is coming later in his presidency than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson, who waited over 10 months after President John F. Kennedy was killed to travel abroad. He is also the first president since Carter to not make his first trip to Mexico or Canada.\nTrump's top advisers insist the President is focused on making deals with foreign leaders in a bid to create a more secure planet, despite the lack of foreign travel. They point to frequent visits from foreign leaders -- including the most recent visit of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -- as proof that Trump has influence on foreign affairs from the White House.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday the President's first trip came after King Salman bin Abd Al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia, President Reuven Rivlin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority extended invites to Trump.\nTrump will also meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican during his trip, Spicer said.",
